Reticulator.js
==============

Reticulator takes its name from the fancy [Fireworks extenison](http://sofanaranja.com/reticulator/) created by [Ale Muñoz](http://bomberstudios.com/). Now this extension is part of [OrangeCommands](http://bomberstudios.com/orangecommands).

I like the CSS frameworks concept like [YUI](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/), [blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/), [960](http://960.gs/), the über complete [compass-style](http://compass-style.org/)... but I like to write all my html and CSS code from the scratch, I only need a guide to fit the design.

With _reticulator.js_ you can define multiple grids, or individual guides to use them as references while you're coding. It's like the Fireworks/Photoshop guides, always over the content.

In guide we trust :)


Yes, you can! (now)
------------------
- Create multiple grids with vertical and horizontal guides
- Create individual vertical and horizontal guides
- Toggle the guides using "g + r"
- Eeehm... anything else
